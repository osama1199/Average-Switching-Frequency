# Average-Switching-Frequency

This model is designed to assist in calculating the average switching frequency in real-time while assessing control techniques and observing the switching frequency applied across the inverter. The gating pulses for the upper switches are provided as inputs, and the model computes the previous states. The final output evaluates the average switching frequency based on these inputs.

Note: Sample time should be adjusted according to the sample time of the simulation.
